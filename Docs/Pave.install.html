    PAVE is available on GitHub from
    <A HREF="https://github.com/cjcoats/pave-3.0"><VAR>&lt;https://github.com/cjcoats/pave-3.0&gt;</VAR></A>.
    To install a copy of this source code from GitHub, go to the
    directory under which do the installation (the default is
    <VAR>${HOME}/apps/</VAR>; to use another directory, you'll
    have to make a few edits, as described in the next section.)
    
    and then do the command
    <PRE>
    git clone https://github.com/cjcoats/pave-3.0
    </PRE>
    This will create and populate a directory <VAR>pave-3.0</VAR> with
    sub-directories <VAR>bin</VAR>, <VAR>include</VAR>, <VAR>info</VAR>,
    <VAR>lib</VAR>, <VAR>man</VAR>, <VAR>maps</VAR>,  <VAR>share</VAR>,
    and <VAR>src</VAR>, as well as files  <VAR>pave-3.0/AAREADME</VAR>, 
    <VAR>pave-3.0/COPYRIGHT</VAR>,  <VAR>pave-3.0/GPL.txt</VAR>, and
    <VAR>pave-3.0/INSTALL</VAR>.
    <P>
    
    Note that this release also contains program <VAR>arc2mcidas</VAR>
    used for converting map-formats from ARC format to the MCIDAS format
    used by PAVE.

    The Git-hub distribution contain (ideally) all the resources
    necessary to run on a current 64-bit x86 Linux system.  These
    resources are built &quot;as statically a possible&quot;, so that
    the executables should run on most systems unchanged.  All that will
    be necessary is to &quot;twiddle&quot; a few directory paths ini
    various files.
    <P>

    Suppose you've installed pave-3.0 under directory <VAR>FOO</VAR> as
    above (where <VAR>FOO</VAR> is not <VAR>${HOME}/apps/</VAR>),
    creating directory <VAR>FOO/pave-3.0</VAR>.  Let us call the
    resulting directory <VAR>PAVE_DIR</VAR>.  You will need to edit the
    following files so that the value of shell-variable
    <CODE>PAVE_DIR</CODE> is now the correct <VAR>FOO/pave-3.0</VAR>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><VAR>

    If your system does not have the <VAR>rxvt</VAR> terminal
    application, you will wish to change the definition of
    <CODE>TERMINAL</CODE> in <VAR>pave-3.0/bin/pave</VAR> to another
    terminal application, such as <VAR>xterm</VAR>.  If you're doing
    PAVE development, you may wish to change the definition of
    <CODE>DEBUGGER</CODE> from <VAR>ddd</VAR> to some other debugger
    such as <VAR>gdbg</VAR> or <VAR>kdbg</VAR>.  Note that
    <VAR>ASSIGNS.debug.csh</VAR> and
    <VAR>pave-3.0/src/Makeinclude.debug</VAR> set up the execution
    environment and the build environment for a debug-compiled PAVE
    executable.
    <P>

    If you source <VAR>pave-3.0/bin/ASSIGNS.csh</VAR>, it will put the
    pave-wrapper script <VAR>pave</VAR> in your <CODE>PATH</CODE>, so
    that you may run it from anywhere you like without having to specify
    its full file-system path.   (This is not _necessary_ of course, and
    there are tricks with <VAR>alias</VAR> to do the same sort of
    thing...)
    <P>

    <STRONG>If you get &quot;shared library&quot; errors on your
    system</STRONG>, you may need to recompile PAVE (below); if you're
    using a completely different compiler system (e.g., using Intel
    compilers), you may need to re-build/re-install the external
    libraries and then re-compile everything (also below).

    This will be done under directory <VAR>pave-3.0/src</VAR>.

    PAVE normally ships with a fairly-complete set of libraries,
    which will be found in the <VAR>pave-3.0/lib</VAR> directory
    (as well as a few &quot;extras&quot; that turn up when you build and
    install these external packages:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><VAR>
        libBLT.a<BR>
        libX11-xcb.a<BR>
        libX11.a<BR>
        libXm.a<BR>
        libXt.a<BR>
        libioapi.a<BR>
        libnetcdf.a<BR>
        libplplotftk.a<BR>
        libproj.a<BR>
        libtcl.a<BR>
        libtk.a<BR>
    </VAR></BLOCKQUOTE>
    These libraries are also built for the <VAR>Linux2_x86_64gfort_medium</VAR>
    compiler-and-memory-model used for the PAVE executable, so
    should not need to be re-built unless you change the memory
    model, etc., or unless you're running on an ancient (e.g., RedHat5)
    system.  If you do, you will need to rebuild and install the libraries
    first; as described in the section below.
    <P>

    File <VAR>pave-3.0/src/Makeinclude</VAR> contains the definitions
    used by <VAR>make</VAR> in order to build the PAVE executable for
    your system.  It is currently set up to use the GNU
    <VAR>gcc/g++/gfortran</VAR> compiler set, to assume that
    I/O&nbsp;API 3.2 is installed under ${HOME}/ioapi-3.2 and also built
    for  <VAR>Linux2_x86_64gfort_medium</VAR> compiler-and-memory-model,
    and to build under directory <CODE>PAVE_DIR</CODE> =
    <VAR>${HOME}/apps/pave-3.0</VAR>.  Files
    <VAR>Makeinclude.template</VAR> and <VAR>Makeinclude.debug</VAR> are
    configuration-controlled templates which can be copied to
    <VAR>Makeinclude</VAR> and then customized for your intended
    installation:
    <OL>

        <LI> Make sure that I/O&nbsp;API version 3.2 is built for the
             binary compile-type you will be using.

        <LI> In particular, make sure the definitions are correct
             for <CODE>BUILD</CODE>, <CODE>PAVE_DIR</CODE>, <CODE>IOSRC</CODE>, and <CODE>IOLIB</CODE>.

        <LI> It is entirely possible that your system may have
             X-windows libraries <VAR>libX11.[so a], libXt.[so a]
             libXm.[so a]</VAR> (most possibly in shared object
             &quot;.so&quot; form).  If so you may want to modify the
             definition of <CODE>EXTLIBS</CODE> to use them. 

        <LI> Your edition of the C++ compiler <VAR>g++</VAR> will somewhere
             have a <VAR>backwards</VAR> directory, so that C++ programs can 
             use (backwards-compatible) C-style include-files.
             Find this directory
             <BLOCKQUOTE><VAR>
                find /usr/include -name backwards
            </VAR></BLOCKQUOTE>
             and modify <CODE>CXXSTUFF</CODE> accordingly.
    </OL>

    If you are building PAVE for some different compiler-set, you
    will need first to do the matching Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API  build (and
    netCDF build), copy or link the <VAR>libioapi.a</VAR> and <VAR>libnetcdf*.a</VAR>
    to <VAR>pave-3.0/lib</VAR>, and then use the I/O API's corresponding
    <VAR>Makeinclude.$BIN</VAR> to provide the definitions used in your
    <VAR>pave-3.0/src/Makeinclude</VAR>.  Also set make-variable <CODE>BUILD</CODE> to the
    <CODE>BIN</CODE> used for the I/O&nbsp;API build.

    Then in directory <VAR>pave-3.0/src</VAR> do the commands
    <VAR>make dirs</VAR> followed by <VAR>make</VAR>.
    Or for PAVE only (and not <VAR>arc2mcidas</VAR>), <VAR>cd pave-3.0/src/pave;
    make dirs; make</VAR>.  If this fails, you will probably need to build
    the external libraries (see section below) and then come back and re-compile.

<H2><A NAME="extern">Building External Libraries</A> </H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    Directory <VAR>pave-3.0/external_libs</VAR> originally contains two
    scripts, <VAR>untar.csh</VAR> and <VAR>buildinstall.csh</VAR>, and a
    directory <VAR>tars</VAR> that contains <VAR>bzip2</VAR>'ed
    <VAR>tar</VAR>-files for the external libraries used.
    <P>

    <VAR>untar.csh</VAR> will uncompress/untar all of the packages under the
    <VAR>pave-3.0/external_libs</VAR>  directory.
    <P>

    In the resulting
    <VAR>pave-3.0/external_libs/blt2.4z/src/bltTree.c</VAR>, we need to
    fix a bug:  the preprocessor definitions for 
    <CODE>START_LOGSIZE</CODE> and <CODE>MAX_LIST_VALUES</CODE> from
    lines 104 and following need to be moved ahead of the <CODE>#if
    (SIZEOF_VOID_P == 8)</CODE>, to line 98.  (This is a bug-fix for
    64-bit medium memory model.)
    <P>

    <VAR>buildinstall.csh</VAR> will attempt to build and install all of
    the resulting libraries, or it may be used as a template giving
    instructions how to configure, build, and install individual
    libraries.  It begins with a number of <VAR>setenv</VAR> definitions
    for directories and for use by GNU <VAR>configure</VAR>.  You will
    need to edit these definitions to match your intended build, as well
    as the I/O&nbsp;API build you intend to use.
    <P>

    These are followed by a sequence of commands that build that package
    and install it under <VAR>pave-3.0/bin</VAR>,
    <VAR>pave-3.0/lib</VAR>, etc:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><VAR>
        cd &lt;package-directory&gt;
        configure &lt;options&gt;
        make
        make install
        </VAR>
        &lt;possible extra commands...&gt;
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    performed in dependency-order (e.g., <VAR>tk</VAR> depends upon
    <VAR>tcl</VAR>, so that <VAR>tcl</VAR> is built and installed
    first).
    <P>

    The build for <VAR>plplot-5.3.1</VAR> fails on my system, but only
    after successfully building <VAR>plrender</VAR>,
    <VAR>plserver</VAR>, and  <VAR>pltcl</VAR>, that will be copied to
    <VAR>pave-3.0/bin</VAR>.
    <P>

    Note that this will have the effect of building not only the
    libraries needed by PAVE, but also a number of other libraries and
    programs (including, for example, even the Motif Window Manger,
    <VAR>mwm</VAR>).  That's the way the GNU <VAR>configure</VAR> script
    works :-)
    <P>

    Note also that we are using an older <VAR>netcdf-3.6.3</VAR>
    version, since for more current netCDF C and Fortran 4.4.x, we had
    troubles getting <VAR>configure</VAR> to work for a
    medium-memory-model build -- <VAR>configure</VAR> claimed it
    couldn't figure out how many bytes were required by a
    medium-memoryu-model C pointer ;-(   If you can fix this for a more
    current netCDF C and Fortran (such as 4.4 or later), I would enjoy
    hearing about it, and updating PAVE accordingly.
    <P>
