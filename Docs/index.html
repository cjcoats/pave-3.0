        <DT> <A HREF = "optimization/efficient_models.html"><STRONG>Optimizing
             Environmental Models for Microprocessor Based
             Systems</STRONG></A>&nbsp;&mdash;
             <EM>The&nbsp;Easy&nbsp;Stuff</EM>
        <DD> Computational efficiency is environmental models is
             affected greatly by two things: (1)&nbsp;that computer memory
             is far slower than the processors, and filtered through a
             &quot;cache&quot; system; and (2) that the processors are
             deeply pipelined and superscalar, attempting to run many
             instructions (in various stages of completion) at one time.
             <P>
             This started as a presentation for US EPA's Office of
             Research and Development in 2002 when the author was at
             MCNC&mdash;North Carolina Supercomputing Center, and has
             been updated from time to time since.  It is amazing just
             how well the lessons of that time have held up&mdash;the
             only thing is that the tendencies noted in 2002 have become
             even stronger over time.

        <DT> <STRONG>The Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API</STRONG>
        <DD> The Models-3/EDSS <STRONG>Input/Output Applications
             Programming Interface (I/O&nbsp;API)</STRONG> provides the
             environmental model developer with an easy-to-learn,
             easy-to-use <STRONG>programming library for data storage
             and access</STRONG>, available from both Fortran and C. The
             I/O&nbsp;API provides a variety of data structure types for
             organizing the data, and a set of access routines which
             offer selective direct access to the data in terms
             meaningful to the modeler, as well as robust error checking
             and reporting &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.
             <P>
             For example,
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
                  Read layer 1 of variable 'OZONE' from 'CONCFILE' for
                  5:00&nbsp;PM GMT on July&nbsp;19, 2018 and put the result
                  into array&nbsp;A.
                  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
             is the direct English translation of a typical I/O&nbsp;API
             <CODE>READ3()</CODE> call.

        <DT><STRONG>PAVE-3.0</STRONG>
        <DD> The <B>Package for Analysis and Visualization of
             Environmental data </B> (PAVE) is a flexible tool to
             visualize multivariate gridded environmental datasets. 
             <STRONG>PAVE Version 3.0</STRONG> is a new release,
             restructured as a stand-alone application, with major
             optimizations (after the fashion of <EM>Optimizing
             Environmental Models</EM>, above), with Linux &quot;medium
             memory-model support&quot;, so that file size, etc., is
             essentially limited by available RAM and inherent netCDF
             limitations,
