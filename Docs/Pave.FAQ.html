    Welcome to the PAVE FAQ.  If your question is not answered below,
    please be sure to examine the <A HREF="PaveManual.html#Bugs">Known
    Bugs and Workarounds for PAVE</A>, and the <A HREF="PaveManual">Main
    PAVE User's Guide</A>.
    <P>

    Note that the corresponding document for PAVE-2.3 was more than a
    decade out of date, and contained many HTML errors, as described by
    <VAR>weblint</VAR>.  In particular, references to EDSS need to be
    re-written.  Revising and correcting it is a non-trivial effort,
    currently in progress...

    PAVE's copyright information can be displayed by typing -copyright
    as a  command line argument, or into PAVE's standard input.  (It is
    long because all of the copyrights for the open source software used

How do I use a world map?
</A></STRONG></H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    As of PAVE-3.0, there are a number of new maps under
    <VAR>pave-3.0/maps</VAR>.
    The <VAR>pave</VAR> wrapper script supports the use
    of two different environment variables to control world-map drawing:
    <DL>
        <DT><VAR>setenv NATIONS_MAP</VAR>
        <DD>uses the <VAR>OUTLNATIONS</VAR> map, with coordinate clipping
            in the (ISO Standard 6709) latitude range [-90,90] and
            longitude range [-180,180].
        <DT><VAR>setenv WORLD_MAP</VAR>
        <DD>uses the <VAR>OUTLNATIONS</VAR> map, with coordinate clipping
            in the (non-Standard, WMO-style)latitude range [-90,90] and
            longitude range [0,360].
    </DL>
    Additionally, the command
    <BLOCKQUOTE><VAR>
    setenv MAP_FILE &lt;file name&gt;
    </VAR></BLOCKQUOTE>
    tells <VAR>pave</VAR> to use the indicated map-file, which may
    either have an absolute path-name, or be a file in the
    <VAR>PAVE_MAPDIR (=pave3.2/maps)</VAR> directory.
    <P>

    As of PAVE version 1.4.1, you can display a world map for
    data whose domain falls partially or completely outside North America.
    First, a little background on how maps are drawn in PAVE.
    Maps are projected onto your data's grid from polylines stored
    in lat/lon coordinates in files in the directory: <p>

<PRE>
&lt;top level PAVE dir&gt;/&lt;platform type&gt;/bin/OPTIMIZE/maps/
</PRE>

    The map files in this directory include:<p>

<PRE>
  OUTLCOUNTIES - county outlines
      OUTLHRES - country outlines for the world
OUTLRIVERS3000 - rivers
 OUTLROADS3000 - roads
OUTLSTATES3000 - high resolution state outlines
      OUTLUSAM - medium resolution state outlines
</PRE>

    Tile plots have a Map menu item which allows you to choose which
    one of these maps will be used in your plot.  The default is
    medium resolution state outlines, which come from the file
    <VAR>OUTLUSAM</VAR>.<p>

    When PAVE projects the map outlines onto your plot, it first
    "pre-clips" out many of the polylines in the file before
    projecting them.  In this way, significant trigonometric
    calculations can be avoided on lines that wouldn't show up
    on your plot anyway.  The default pre-clip range is as follows:<p>

<PRE>
	llLat =   10.0
	llLon = -125.0
	urLat =   80.0
	urLon =  -60.0
</PRE>

    Lines falling outside of the pre-clip range will not be
    drawn on your PAVE plot.  So any domain which partially
    or completely falls outside of this default pre-clip range
    will have an incomplete map when rendered within a default
    PAVE tile plot.  The way to get around this is two-fold: first
    you will need to modify the default pre-clip range used by PAVE,
    and second you'll need to tell PAVE to use the world map rather
    than the default medium resolution state outlines.<p>

    <STRONG>To modify the default pre-clip range used by PAVE</STRONG>, you can
    use either 1) environment variables set prior to launching PAVE,
    2) command line arguments sent to PAVE at startup, or 3)
    arguments sent to PAVE's standard input after startup.  First,
    choose a clipping range (bounded by lower-left and upper-right
    latitude, longitude coordinate pairs) that will enclose the
    entire geographic domain of your dataset.  To use environment
    variables, enter the following commands at the command line
    prior to launching PAVE:<p>

<PRE>
	setenv PRECLIP_LLLAT &lt;llLat&gt;
	setenv PRECLIP_LLLON &lt;llLon&gt;
	setenv PRECLIP_URLAT &lt;urLat&gt;
	setenv PRECLIP_URLON &lt;urLon&gt;
</PRE>

    Arguments used to modify the pre-clip range used by PAVE, are of the
    form:<p>

<PRE>
	-preClip &lt;llLat&gt; &lt;llLon&gt; &lt;urLat&gt; &lt;urLon&gt;
</PRE>

    In either of the above cases, all subsequent tile plots in that PAVE
    session will use the newly supplied default clipping  range until
    the range is changed again.<p>

    <STRONG>To tell PAVE to use the world map rather than the default
    medium resolution state outlines</STRONG>, there are two methods.
    One way is to use the <VAR>-mapName</VAR> command line argument with
    the full pathname/filename to the <VAR>OUTLHRES</VAR> file :<p>
<PRE>
-mapName "&lt;pathname&gt;/&lt;mapFileName&gt;"
</PRE>
    causes PAVE to use the supplied map name instead of the
    default map for all subsequent tile plots.
    An easier way to obtain the same results for a given plot
    is to simply use a tile plot's pull down "Map" menu to select
    the world map, and that plot will then use the world map.
    However if you are creating multiple plots of your data, you
    will probably find the first method easier, as it affects
    all subsequent plots rather than just a single plot.<p>

    <STRONG>Here is an example script</STRONG> which was used to create
    a tile plot with a dataset whose domain stretches from
    North America over to Europe and down to North Africa:

<PRE>
#!/bin/csh
#
# world map example script
#

-mapName \

How do I use my own map background?
</A></STRONG></H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    PAVE maps are stored in a binary format called McIDAS.
    McIDAS is a tricky little format, but it is very efficient space wise.
    The data itself is a series of polylines in lat/lon coordinates.
    You can specify for PAVE to use a different McIDAS map background
    file by using PAVE's -mapName argument. <p>

    There is now a utility called <VAR>arc2mcidas</VAR> that
    allows you to translate ArcInfo '.gen' files with
    map line data into the McIDAS format, and then
    read it into PAVE.  <VAR>arc2mcidas</VAR> is distributed
    with the latest PAVE release; you should be able to find it in <p>
    <PRE>
&lt;top level PAVE dir&gt;/&lt;platform type&gt;/bin/OPTIMIZE/<VAR>arc2mcidas</VAR>
    </PRE><p>

    The <VAR>arc2mcidas</VAR> input .gen format is pretty simple to get
    your data into, if you don't already have ArcInfo to generate that
    kind of file for you.  Here is an excerpt from a sample .gen file:

    The format of the .gen files used as input to the

    of polylines, each polyline's data is denoted by:
<PRE>
-------------------------------------------------
&lt;integer polyline number&gt;
  &lt;float lat1&gt; &lt;float lon1&gt;
  &lt;float lat2&gt; &lt;float lon2&gt;

  &lt;float lastlat&gt; &lt;float lastlon&gt;

    where the polyline number is totally ignored by <VAR>arc2mcidas</VAR>,
    and the lons are negative in the western hemisphere, the lats
    negative in the southern hemisphere, and every lat and lon
    must have a decimal in it.  (note the ---- lines aren't part
    of the file format). <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    PAVE currently supports four input file formats: IO/API (netCDF), UAM-IV, UAM-V,
    and "chain files".  These formats are further described in PAVE's User Guide,
    at <A HREF="PaveManual#Data">PaveManual#Data</A>.
    <p>

    If you have another data format which you would like to look at using PAVE,
    you should probably convert it into Models-3 I/O&nbsp;API format.
    There are a number of I/O&nbsp;API &quot;m3tools&quot; programs
    which can either do the task directly or which could be adapted to
    serve your needs.  See

set up is correct (see the Requirements for Use section of the PAVE User
Guide), all you should need to do is to click on the button in the center of
the EDSS File Browser and pick a different machine on which to browse data.
However, things are more complicated (but not impossible) if you can't rsh to
the machine.  <p>

First, you need to configure your account on the <STRONG>remote machine</STRONG>.
(This should only need to be done once if you usually run PAVE on the same local
machine.)  To do this, add the following to your ~/.cshrc on that machine:<p>
<UL>
<LI>setenv EDSS_HOST <i>your_local_machine_name</i>
<LI>setenv EDSS_HOST_USER <i>your_local_userid</i>
<LI>setenv EDSS_HOST_IP <i>IP_address_for_your_local_machine</i>
<LI>setenv EDSS_DIR <i>dir_where_PAVE_is_installed</i>
<LI>source $EDSS_DIR/scripts/setup_edss
</UL><p>

Here the local_machine is the machine on which you will be running the  PAVE
user interface.  To have the changes take effect, type source ~/.cshrc on the
remote machine.  Type `which visd` on the remote machine and make sure it
returns a directory name.  If it doesn't, then the setup_edss script on the
remote machine may not be properly configured.<p>

To get started viewing remote data,<p>
<UL>
<LI> start pave on the local machine
<LI> let <i>myport</i> be the contents of /tmp/sbus_port_$USER on the local machine
<LI> log on to the <STRONG>remote machine</STRONG>, and type start_edss_daemons -port
<i>myport</i> all
</UL><p>

If things have worked properly, you should see some messages appear on the
remote machine.  You should then be able to browse remote data on that machine.
To choose the remote machine for browsing files, click on the button in the
center of the browser (below the file and directory lists) and type in a
host.<p>

<STRONG>For example</STRONG>, assume the local machine = tom.ncsc.org, the local user
ID is george, and the remote machine=flyer.ncsc.org.<p>

<UL>
<LI>On flyer: vi ~/.cshrc
<LI>setenv EDSS_HOST tom.ncsc.org
<LI>setenv EDSS_HOST_USER george
<LI>setenv EDSS_HOST_IP 201.27.302.16
<LI>setenv EDSS_DIR /usr/local/PAVE
<LI>source $EDSS_DIR/scripts/setup_edss
<LI>On tom, more /tmp/sbus_port_george gives: 47293; so on flyer I type <br>
    start_edss_daemons -port 47293 all
</UL>
<p>
Note that you will need to do the last step only each time you want to browse
data with a new PAVE session.

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    Sometimes, PAVE is unable to allocate a color that it tried to allocate.  In
    this case, you will see black regions appear in the legend of your tile plot.
    This situation usually occurs when you have gone back and forth between
    different color maps or adjusted the # Tiles slider multiple times.  This is
    often accompanied by a message to standard output that says "Can't allocate
    ramp color xxx".  To clear this situation, exit and restart PAVE.  Note that
    the number of available colors can be affected by other applications running on
    your workstation that are using colors (such as netscape or mosaic).  You
    can control the number of colors used by netscape with the -ncols command
    line argument.  PAVE and netscape coexist better if you run netscape in the
    following way:
<PRE>
netscape -ncols 64

    If you cannot get enough colors by restarting PAVE, try quitting
    other applications that use a lot of colors and then restart

How do I view a vector plot (e.g. for wind data)?
</A></STRONG></H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    To view a vector plot, first load and select the data set that contains the
    vector data.  Let's assume that this is wind data for this example.
    Next, click on each of the vector "species" in the species list for the
    file (e.g. UWINDa and VWINDa) to add them to the formula list.
    Then, paste a line like this into the window from which you started
    PAVE (i.e. PAVE's standard input):
<PRE>
-vector UWINDa VWINDa
</PRE>
    This will cause PAVE to draw a basic vector plot.  By default the plot will
    appear with fixed length vectors.  You can make the vectors scaled by their
    size using the Configure window for the vector plot - click on "Scale
    Vectors".
    <p>

    If you are doing a vector plot from a script, you must enter the following
    commands before the -vector command:
    <p>

-s UWINDa
-s VWINDa

How do I view a vector plot with another (scalar) variable in the background?
</A></STRONG></H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    You can plot a variable in the background behind the vectors of a
    vector plot (but the other variable must be on the same grid).  For
    example, if you  loaded in a temperature data set for the same grid
    that the wind data is on,  you can paste a line like the following
    into PAVE's standard input:
<PRE>
-vectorTile TMPRh UWINDa VWINDa
</PRE>

    and you will get a plot with wind vectors in the foreground and
    color temperature data as tiles in the background.  A more common
    use might be to plot wind speed in the background like this:
<PRE>
-s UWINDa
-s VWINDa
-s "sqrt(UWINDa*UWINDa+VWINDa*VWINDa)"
-vectorTile "sqrt(UWINDa*UWINDa+VWINDa*VWINDa)" UWINDa VWINDa
</PRE>

    The first lines add the formulas for the scalar wind compenents and
    the wind  speed to the formula list, and the last line draws the
    plot.  This way you can show wind direction with fixed length vector
    and wind speed in the background.
    <p>

    Note that you don't have to "type" the lines into standard input -
    you  can copy and paste them with your X-windows system (with the
    middle mouse button  if you're using <VAR>xterms</VAR>).

How do I view a vertical cross-section of data?
</A></STRONG></H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    To view a vertical cross section of data using the Tile Plot, first
    select the dataset in the Dataset List for which you would like to
    view the cross  section. Then under the datasets menu, choose
    "Select Layer Ranges Matching  Current Dataset".  You should see a
    window with sliders for the highest and  lowest layers to use.  Set
    these appropriately depending on which layers you  want to see.  To
    see a vertical cross section, the lowest and highest should be
    different layers (as opposed to just plotting a horizontal cross
    section -  in that case the min and max layers are set to the same
    value). <I>[Note that you can also select a layer range for a
    <STRONG>formula</STRONG> using the corresponding  options under the
    Formulas menu.]</I>
    <p>

    After selecting the layers you want to see, type a statement of the
    following form into PAVE's standard input:
<PRE>
-subdomain 80 20 80 90
</PRE>
    Here the arguments to -subdomain are: x1 y1 x2 y2 to define the
    region to be selected.  This will cause the data where x = 80, and y
    is between 20 and 90 to be selected.  To see this region on the
    screen, you can choose  "Select Regions of Interest Matching Current
    Dataset".  A window showing  the domain will come up.
    Alternatively, you can select the cells with the mouse, but this
    gets difficult when grid cells are small and you want to select a
    very  precise area.
    <p>

    Now that the layers and region to be plotted are selected, you need
    to set the cross section type.  Under the Graphics menu, choose "Set
    Tile Plot Cross Section Type" and you will see a submenu of X, Y, or
    Z cross sections. To make a plot for the above example choose "X
    Cross Section" (remember this by noting that x is constant).  Next,
    draw the plot with a formula using your dataset by choosing "Create
    Tile  Plot" from the Graphics menu, and you will see the plot of
    that cross section. Currently, you cannot draw vectors on vertical
    cross section plots.

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
&gt; Hi:
&gt; Assuming that mean would provide average I tried and
&gt; found that it does not work, The error is 'a formula must
&gt; produce a grid of data' It appears that PAVE is intending to
&gt; generate a number rather than averaging each grid cell in time.
&gt; I a m using the data consisting of 24 hr extract as xymap*.
&gt; Can you provide any explanation for the following mean,
&gt; sum, mint, and maxt  which are part of PAVE formulas?
&gt; Thanks
</PRE><p>

    The operators you mention produce a single number calculated over
    the currently selected levels, rows, columns, and time steps for the
    given formula.  The version of PAVE you have (PAVE 1.4beta or
    earlier) expects to always calculate an array of data to make a plot
    - so if your formula is something like <VAR>mean(O3a)</VAR>, you get
    that message. If the formula is <VAR>mean(O3a)/NO2a</VAR>, you will
    get a plot.<p>

    Subsequent versions of PAVE changed how this is handled.  If you
    make a "plot" of <VAR>mean(O3a)</VAR>, PAVE will now calculate the
    result and display it in the PAVE message window along with
    information about the currently selected domain from which that
    number was calculated. <p>

    Here is what the operators you mention above specifically do, along
    with a number of other operators which also return a single
    number:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <DL>
        <DT><STRONG>mean</STRONG>

    where "currently selected domain" includes the currently

    currently selected domain is bounded by
    <BLOCKQUOTE><VAR>
        (minx,miny,minz,mint)&lt;-&gt;(maxx,maxy,maxz,maxt)

        <DT><STRONG>max</STRONG>
        <DD>For each cell <VAR>(i,j,k)</VAR> in the currently selected domain,
            this calculates the maximum value for that cell

            the maximum value in cells <VAR>(i,j,k,tmin..tmax)</VAR>.
    </DL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    Prior to PAVE version 2.1 alpha, there was a way (albeit
    cumbersome!)  to get PAVE to average each grid cell in time.  PAVE
    has a not well-known feature which allows you to specify an hour
    index after a variable name.  For example, <STRONG>O3a:1 is the
    first hour of ozone</STRONG>.  So, if you wanted to plot an each
    cell averaged in time over the first twelve hours of your data, you
    could enter and plot the following formula:<p>

<STRONG>(O3a:1+O3a:2+O3a:3+O3a:4+O3a:5+O3a:6+O3a:7+O3a:8+O3a:9+O3a:10+O3a:11+O3a:12)/12</STRONG><p>

    This is cumbersome and it also uses a lot of memory
    <p>

    We currently recommend that you download the latest version of PAVE,
    and use the <VAR>-nhouraverage</VAR> option, or from the Graphics
    menu, select the Create NHour Average Tile Plot Menu item.<p>

    If you get a segmentation fault when running PAVE, but the super-user and
    the owner of the PAVE directories can run successfully, there is a
    likely file permission problem.  Try changing the permissions of the
    .pave_exe.pave_usage.log file in your installation directory to be

    There is a problem with PAVE's Export to netCDF feature in PAVE
    versions  prior to 1.5.  If you export  a formula more complex than
    a single species to netCDF, PAVE names the  variable in such a way
    that it can't read the exported dataset back in. You may be able to
    read the dataset if you successfully update the variable name in the
    netCDF header.  If you are having this problem and are using a

    The UAM-V documentation specifies that the dates in coarse grid

    ASCII, change the date to YYDDD, then change it back to binary; or
    if you want to look at OTAG data, try getting xymap (low level

    The PostScript format saved to by PAVE is simply a pixel map, so it
    doesn't actually have the drawing commands in it to provide good
    resolution on a printer.  However, one workaround you could try is
    making your image huge.  This would provide better resolution on a

    <p>

    You can resize a PAVE plot window interactively, or you can control
    the exact size of an image (height and width) using PAVE command
    line arguments <VAR>-height</VAR> and <VAR>-width</VAR>.  If you'd
    like to make an image really really huge (bigger than the screen,
    for example), you'd need to use this method.  See the PAVE
    documentation at

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    If you get an X Error such as BadDrawable when creating a plot in a

<PRE>
...
-titleString "Layer 1 VOC to NOx Ratio" \

-subTitle2 " &lt; 4 = VOC limited, &gt; 15 = NOx limited" \
-gtype tile -saveImage MPEG /ssa/modeling/uamv/post/ratio88b.mpg \
</PRE>
    This is due to a timing problem.  You can correct this by placing:
    <CODE>-system \"sleep 5\</CODE> in between the <CODE>-gtype tile</CODE>
    and the <CODE>-saveImage</CODE>.
    This gives the plot time to draw before saving it.

<H2><STRONG><A name="obscuredAnimation">
Why is part of the animation I saved obscured by non-PAVE windows?
</A></STRONG></H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The way images are saved in PAVE is by grabbing it off of the
    X-windows display (after which point it is saved to an XWD formatted
    image and then converted to gif or another format).  Therefore if
    there is another window obscuring all or part of the image while it
    is being saved, that part of the other window will be saved instead.
    <p> 
    
    Thus, if you are exporting animations or otherwise saving images
    in PAVE, the window of interest must be in the foreground and should
    not be obscured by any other windows during the time that the images
    are captured.  When saving an animation, the images are first
    captured, and then go through several conversion steps.  It is OK to
    put the PAVE window in the background during the conversion steps
    (i.e. once it has finished animating the image).

    You cannot combine two datasets with different grid resolutions in a
    formula in PAVE (e.g. to calculate a difference).  Think of the
    datasets as matrices - you can't add or subtract two matrices of
    different dimensions and get a meaningful result.  If you need to do
    something like this, use a program external to PAVE to aggregate the
    finer grid to the same dimensions as the coarser one or to
    interpolate the coarser grid to the same dimensions as the finer
    one, then load the resulting dataset into PAVE.

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    9.49e-02

    These configurations can be saved to a file, and used in future

        <P>
        (This is being funded for development for PAVE release 2.1 Alpha) <p>
        There are many possibilities here - we can plot explicit points, or gridded
        observations.  There are a several potential types of rendering including
        colored circles or textual numbers at observation sites, and contour lines
        showing the observations (with the first two being easier to incorporate).
        It is likely that once we have the ability to plot explicit points, we can use
        the software to view point source emissions data of various types.<p>

        <LI><STRONG> Improve scripting capabilities</STRONG><p>

        All
        (This is being funded for development for PAVE release 2.1 Alpha) <p>
        PAVE capabilities (as are practical) should be available via scripts and
        standard input.<p>

        <LI><STRONG> Improved statistical capabilities</STRONG><p>

           People often want to use simple statistics to assist with there data
        analysis (e.g. mean, std. dev.).  It would be good if PAVE could produce
        these.  In addition, people may want to slice the data in different ways to
        obtain these statistics (e.g. mean for each time step or for each vertical
        layer).  There are also a number of commonly used statistics that deal with
        comparing model data with observations.  We may want to examine the "tables"
        generated for OTAG for ideas for other typically used statistics.<p>

        <LI><STRONG> Optimize PAVE performance and memory usage</STRONG><p>

        <EM>DONE for pave-3.0</EM>
        <P>
        PAVE performance, both CPU and memory related, can be improved in a number
        of ways.  For example, loops can be reordered to reduce paging to disk, memory
        leaks can be plugged, and memory can be reused in some formulas.<p>

        <LI><STRONG> User interface improvements</STRONG><p>

       The PAVE user interface could use a number of enhancements.  Probably the
        most important of these is to make all plots accessible via the user
        interface.  For example, vector plots, scatter plots, and time series plots
        with multiple lines are not currently available via the user interface.  In
        addition, small usability improvements could include: an hourglass cursor when
        PAVE is busy, an indicator of which "mode" a PAVE tile plot is in (e.g.
        probing, zooming, time series), making changes to the min and max take effect
        without hitting return, giving windows more meaningful names, and many more.<p>

        <LI><STRONG> Add new types of plots and options for existing ones</STRONG><p>

           Additional kinds of plots have been requested by users.  Some examples
        include: vertical cross section plots where the size of the layers is
        proportional to actual layer size, vertical profiles, contour plots, flux
        plots, observational data plots described above, PIG plots, nested grid plots,
        adaptive grid plots, box & whisker plots.  Also, making scatter plots internal
        to PAVE would help reduce the problems associated with transferring data to
        BLT and would provide additional flexibility.<p>

        <LI><STRONG> Improve usability of long formulas</STRONG><p>

           Currently, long formulas are often difficult to use.  This might be
        improved by providing some defaults for commonly used long formulas (e.g. VOC,
        TOC, wind speed).  Allowing user-defined aliases for long formulas and
        hierarchical formulas (e.g. NOy - NOx) would be very useful.  Allowing
        the user to specify that multiple parts of a formula refer to the same data
        set would reduce the complexity involved with long formulas (e.g. [NO + NO2]a
        where the a is applied to both NO and NO2).<p>

        <LI><STRONG> Improve use of map backgrounds</STRONG><p>

           It would be useful to be able to plot multiple maps (e.g. state + counties,
        or counties + roads) using different colors and thicknesses as needed.
        Another possibility would be to allow backgrounds generated by packages such
        as GISs to be displayed - these might show roads, water, cities, etc.  <p>

        <LI><STRONG> Increase configurability of plots</STRONG><p>

           It would be useful in some cases to allow users to define the cutoffs
        between the colors plotted (currently PAVE makes each bin of equal size from
        the min to the max).  Another alternative might include assigning bins according
        to percentiles.  Additional configuration options could be added to vector
        plots wrt the density of the vectors plotted.<p>

        <LI><STRONG> Rework color usage </STRONG><p>

           We might use the colors allocated by netscape so the two packages do not
        fight for colors, we could prevent allocation of colors that are not
        actually being used, and provide the user with the option of a private color
        table so that PAVE is not at the mercy of other applications when allocating
        colors.  Also, we could improve the options for black and white plots by
        adding patterns to the existing shades of gray.<p>

        <LI><STRONG> Improve plot labeling & layout</STRONG><p>

           The density and location of grid cell numbering on tile plots and in the
        domain selector could be improved. Also, the legend could be outlined in black
        to set off any white or light values and be positioned relative to the size of
        the legend labels.  The size of tile plots could be made user configurable,
        and the aspect ratio preserved when the plot is manually resized.  Data
        plotted on time series plots could be labeled more clearly.  <p>

        <LI><STRONG> Improve Data Import / Export capabilities</STRONG><p>

        (This is being funded for development for PAVE release 2.1 Alpha) <p>
           It may be possible to include additional readers for PAVE.  Also,
        enhancements of the data export facility would be very useful.  For example,
        one might want to create a new data set out of components several other data
        sets, or from the result of several complex formulas.  For this, PAVE would
        need to allow multiple formulas to be selected for export, and allow the
        renaming of variables in the output dataset (e.g. call a variable NOy instead
        of the long formula used to calculate NOy).  <p>
